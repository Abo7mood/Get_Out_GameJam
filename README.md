## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

This game was born out of a **game jam**, where my team and I wanted to challenge conventional game controls. Instead of using a keyboard or controller, we aimed to create something truly **unique**—a game that is **fully controlled by voice**!

The journey was filled with excitement and experimentation. Developing **voice recognition mechanics** within a short timeframe was a challenge, but it pushed us to explore new solutions and refine our creativity.

Although it was a game jam project, this experience taught us a lot about **player interaction, accessibility, and unconventional game mechanics**. The project remains a testament to how innovation and constraints can lead to incredible ideas. 🎉
